# Known issues
 - The SAFE formatting application sometimes outputs mosaics with black edges around tile edges
 - The SAFE formatting application sometimes outputs unusable (e.g. black) previews
 - The SAFE and L2A product previews are not gamma-corrected and can be too dark
 - The SAFE validation step flags as invalid products with even a single tile having a low-variance band as invalid (`NOTV`)
 - The crop type and crop mask processors don't perform the normalization step properly when using SVM classification
 - The crop type and mask training step sometimes crashes while loading the OpenCV models
 - MACCS can sometimes crash or hang under high load: https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/commit/d68c1c0f23fea97ab782c185095b4ef3259cec68
 - The MACCS launcher script does not process different tiles of the same site in parallel
 - The product formatting and tile aggregation steps are inefficient
 - Performance of the multi-tile Crop Type and Crop Mask processors can be poor for tiles with a large number of input products, especially on hardware with a large number of cores
 - The trimming step of the Crop Mask processor still uses a large amount of memory
 - The unsupervised Crop Mask processor expects a reference map with the ESA-CCI LC map labels
 - The dashboard previews don't match their bounds rectangle because of projection mismatch
 - The LAI model is created for each tile. The SDD and ATBD should be updated if another behaviour is desired and needs to be implemented.
 - The website has display issues on Safari

# Change Log

## [1.8.0] - TBD
### Added
 - The L4A/L4B processors use a platform-independent algorithm for the training/validation split. This is a step towards allowing the processor to work on other platforms and give the same results.

### Changed
 - Breaking change: the L4A and L4B processors now use a different algorithm for the trainig/validation split. Output files will be different from the ones in the previous versions. The accuracy scores will often be lower because poorly-represented classes will now be present in the validation set. They weren't taken into account previously.
 - The SampleSelection application places all the features in both the training and the validation sets if there are too few of them and one of them would end up empty according to the configured split (e.g. 75% training with only 2 features). This allows taking them into account for validation, although with lower accuracy.

### Fixed
 - Fixed crash in the SampleSelection application used by the L4 processors when a feature with no geometry is present
 - The SampleSelection application always puts features in one of the training or validation set. Previously, they were sometimes lost.

## [1.7.0] - TBD
### Added
 - The unsupervised crop mask processor can now use (optionally, on by default) the red edge bands
 - Added support to `sen2agri-downloader` for ingesting data from a local archive
 - The system should now download and process Sentinel-2 B products
 - Added a new flag for L1C products processing in order to determine if the product was handled OK or not by MACCS.
 - Support in the Sentinel2 downloader in order to use local store for the L1C products.

### Changed
 - Products in the `RT` and `T2` Landsat 8 collections are no longer downloaded
 - Changed the crop mask post-filtering to ignore negative reflectance values
 - Reduced the CPU usage of the crop mask post-filtering NDVI extraction step by 20%, and the wall clock time by 15% when running with 4 threads
 - Reduced the CPU and disk usage by merging the crop mask post-filtering no data filling and PCA steps; CPU usage went down by 27% and disk usage by about 20 GB for a single tile
 - The Landsat 8 downloader no longer prints a status line if the standard output is not a TTY
 - Dropped local GDAL install and `cifs-utils` dependency
 - The Sentinel-2 downloader now accepts products that are missing a cloud coverage value, as SciHub seems to no longer return it

### Fixed
 - Fixed an issue that made the crop mask post-filtering output invalid rasters when both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 products were used for post-filtering; this was disabled by default
 - Changed the post-filtered crop mask data type from `Float32` to `Int16`
 - Fixed an issue that caused the supervised crop mask processor to crash on tiles spanned by multiple strata
 - Fixed an issue that sometimes caused MACCS to be passed an L3C product instead of the previous L2A one

 - The binaries were recompiled for `GEOS 1.5`
 - Increased crop mask and crop type tile thread hint from `2` to `5` to reduce the risk of out-of-memory conditions

### Fixed
 - Changed the advanced mode for processors parameters in the sen2agri-config configuration.
 - In IPP file name for L3A is not inserted the used bands_mapping and not the one from the DB.

## [1.3.1] - 2016-10-10
### Added
 - A change log
 - Multi-tile implementations of the Crop Type and supervised Crop Mask processors which should be faster and use less temporary disk space. The new executables are called `CropTypeFused.py` and `CropMaskFused.py`. [Forge #150414]
 - The processors mentioned above support classification over multiple strata in a single site
 - The processors mentioned above now create a parameters file (`IPP`) even when run in the manual mode. Note that the XML schema has changed from previous versions.
 - Upgrading from `1.3` to `1.3.1` is now possible by running the `update.sh` script. Upgrading from previous versions is not supported. Upgrading directly from `1.3` will not be possible in future versions.
 - The SAFE formatting application now accepts the desired output SRS. This is not available when running the processors. [Forge #150440]
 - A script to insert L2A products into the database (`insert_l2a_product_to_db.py`)
 - New keys in the database config for the QOS names for each processor used to limit the number of jobs of a processor to be executed at a given moment of time in Slurm
 - Added removal of temporary files also during the execution of jobs for Composite and LAI (and not only at the end)

### Changed
 - Slight performance improvement for unsupervised Crop Mask processor from writing fewer temporary files to disk
 - Reduced by about half the memory usage of the unsupervised crop mask training step
 - Reduced by about half the memory usage of the unsupervised crop mask trimming step
 - Increased default supervised crop mask training sample count from `4000` to `40000`
 - Changed default crop type and crop mask resampling mode from `gapfill` to `resample`
 - Updated SNAP adapters
 - The dashboard no longer performs AJAX requests to a web service running on port `8080`. This simplifies deployment behind a firewall and makes reverse proxy-ing possible. When configuring a reverse proxy, note that the dashboard still assumes it's running from the root of the site, so rewrite rules need to be defined accordingly.
 - The install script is now more robust against being run multiple times without dropping the `sen2agri` PostgreSQL database. This is still not a supported scenario.
 - Temporary files are now removed when running the the automated mode
 - Landsat 8 download works again by making use of the CSRF token on the USGS site
 - The `sen2agri-processors` package now increases the open file limit (`nofile`) by via a file under `/etc/security/limits.d/`

### Fixed
 - The server hostname no longer needs to be configured in `ConfigParams.php`. This should have been done by the installer, but was unreliable at times
 - The dashboard products page is now much faster
 - The dashboard no longer displays the load average multiplied by 100
 - The SAFE formatting application chose the output SRS at random when creating the `LEGACY_DATA` mosaics and previews. It now chooses the one that is the most common among the product tiles
 - The number of concurrent jobs started at once in the automated mode can now limited via the `GrpJobs` SLURM `QOS` parameter (e.g. `sacctmgr modify qos qoscomposite set GrpJobs=5`)
 - A missing `gdal-python` dependency was added to the `sen2agri-processors` package
 - Fixed proxy usage in the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 downloaders
 - The `sen2agri-executor` daemon and the downloader and `sen2agri-demmaccs` timers now start automatically after a system reboot
 - The `demmaccs.py` script no longer fails when given paths that don't end in a directory separator
 - Correction for low value reflectances in the composite (correction for error in ATBD)

### Security
 - The dashboard no longer calls via AJAX an unauthenticated web service endpoint
